                <p>In Australia, class is not very visible. We’re a have-a-go country where the concept of the blue-collar hard worker is idolised.</p>

                <p>We don’t have the slums or extreme poverty that other countries have.</p>

                <p>But don’t be fooled. The divisions of class are hidden, yet if you look hard enough you will find very tangible class structures. And these structures confine us in all sorts of ways, in all aspects of our lives.</p>

                <p>Our previous approach was to depict the experiences of poverty, extrapolate those out into a statistical context, and then concrete those ideas within the Brisbane landscape.</p>
                <p>We have decided to reduce our scope to focus specifically on class structures. This means we don't have to work hard to connect individual ethnographies into our geographic message.</p>
                <p>Instead of ethnographically depicting the lives of others, we will have our audience reflect on their own position within class, tying it to their own position within Brisbane society.</p>
                <p>This fits closer to our wide conceptualisation of class. One that is not just financial, but social, cultural, and geographic.</p>

                <p>We will use imagery to reflect our structural view. This includes the infrastructure of brisbane, and the mechanisms in which people move and operate, as system.</p>

                <h1 class="arrow">Method & Platform</h1>
                <p>In order to convey the importance of class on living standards, we aim to marry the personal aspects of disadvantage, the mechanisms and structures of class, and the actual social spaces the audience inhabits.</p>

                <p class="compacted">First, we want to immerse the viewer into the experiences of the lower classes. The best format for this is video - the individual is placed with the camera into their environment, and the viewer can see it from their perspective.</p>

                <p class="compacted">Secondly, we want to represent relevant statistics and concepts that inform our thinking. Users should be able to process and consider these at their own pace, and consider the ramifications for themselves.</p>

                <p class="compacted">Third, we want to relate these facts back into the concrete world in which the audience inhabits.</p>

                <p>In order to achieve each, we will take up a multimedia approach. A website containing both video to immerse viewers into a lived experience, and to control the visual hierarchy, while letting viewers explore the page at their own pace.</p>

                <h1 class="arrow">Collaborative Production</h1>
                <p>Our production is driven by two parts.</p>

                <p>The first is an in-depth ethnographic exploration into the financially disadvantaged areas of Brisbane. We plan to work with the organisations and charities to gain first-hand experiences of this environment, and will capture it in film and photographs as we go.</p>

                <p>The second is the exploratory development of our site. We expect our approach to the site will evolve over time, and we want to achieve a good level of technical polish without biting off more than we can chew. </p>

                <p>As such, we will take an incremental, experimental approach to developing our site. Each week or fortnight, we will decide on a part of the site to prototype, to test a new approach, technique or method of conveying information.</p>
